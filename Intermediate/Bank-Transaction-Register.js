/* Challenge

Create a JavaScript program that allows the user to perform a single operation from a menu with four options: Deposit, Withdraw, Balance and Exit. After choosing one of these options, the program should execute the corresponding operation and display the updated balance information. After executing the operation, the program will close automatically.
Entry:

    The program starts with a fictitious bank account, with the following information:
        Customer Name: Jo√£o
        Initial balance: R$ 1,000.00

    The user interacts with the program via a menu with the following options:
        Deposit: The user enters the amount of the deposit, which is added to the account balance.
        Withdrawal: The user enters the withdrawal amount, which is deducted from the balance, provided there is sufficient balance.
        Balance: The program displays the current balance of John's account.
        Exit: The user can close the program.

Exit:

The program should execute one of the 4 menu options (Deposit/Draw/Balance/Exit) and display the updated balance information. 
If you enter option 4, you should get the message "Closing program". */
